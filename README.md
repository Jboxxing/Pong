# Pong

A game taken from the tutorial --> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIqeK2hzx1I  

Features I added: score keeping/score board, play again after a round is over (when a player scores a point), game over changed to after
a player scores 5 points in total, 2 player mode (in addition to the 1 player mode with an AI)
